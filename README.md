# Eye-Gaze-Controlled-Keyboard

A virtual keyboard controlled using **eye gaze and blinks**, designed for users with severe disabilities. The keyboard allows typing by navigating keys with eye movement and selecting letters or actions with blinks.

## How It Works
- **Navigate Keys:** Look left or right to move the focus between keys horizontally.  
- **Select Key:** Close both eyes for 2–3 seconds to type the focused letter.  
- **Emergency Button:** Blink on the emergency button to send an alert to a caretaker’s phone.  
- **Predictive Text:** The keyboard suggests words dynamically as letters are typed.
